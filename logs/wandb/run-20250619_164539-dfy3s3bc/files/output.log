- At the beginning of the conversation, authenticate the user by finding their user ID via email, or name and zip code. Prioritize email if available.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the exchange_delivered_order_items or return_delivered_order_items tool has already been called once, do not call it again. Instead, create a new order for the user.

- When creating a new order, make sure to gather all required information (item ids, quantities, shipping address, payment information, etc.) before placing the order.

- Always confirm with the user that you have understood all of their requests and that the new order reflects their needs accurately.

- Clearly explain the steps needed to return the original items and any associated costs or refunds.

- Before using 'exchange_delivered_order_items' or 'return_delivered_order_items', ALWAYS call 'get_order_details' first to retrieve the original item IDs. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the exchange_delivered_order_items tool correspond to what the customer has in their order.

- After calling 'get_order_details', extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids.

- When using 'exchange_delivered_order_items', ensure that the 'new_item_ids' correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function.

- Before calling 'exchange_delivered_order_items', confirm the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?' Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user.

- After confirming the item IDs with the user, proceed to call the 'exchange_delivered_order_items' function with the correct 'item_ids', 'new_item_ids', 'order_id', and 'payment_method_id'.

- Double check the item descriptions before providing them to the user. The information should align with what's presented in the tool's output. For example, confirm switch types and backlight options of the mechanical keyboard.

[Step 18] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user** at the beginning of the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the exchange_delivered_order_items or return_delivered_order_items tool has already been called once, do not call it again. Instead, create a new order for the user. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools.**

- When creating a new order, make sure to gather all required information (item ids, quantities, shipping address, payment information, etc.) before placing the order. **Use the 'think' tool to plan the steps before creating a new order.**

- Always confirm with the user that you have understood all of their requests and that the new order reflects their needs accurately.

- Clearly explain the steps needed to return the original items and any associated costs or refunds. **Provide a clear breakdown of costs, refunds, and any price differences for exchanges or returns.**

- Before using 'exchange_delivered_order_items' or 'return_delivered_order_items', ALWAYS call 'get_order_details' first to retrieve the original item IDs. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the exchange_delivered_order_items tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling 'get_order_details', extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids.

- **Critical:** When using 'exchange_delivered_order_items', ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.**

- When using 'exchange_delivered_order_items', ensure that the 'new_item_ids' correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.**

- Before calling 'exchange_delivered_order_items', confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including 'order_id', 'item_ids', 'new_item_ids', and 'payment_method_id', with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?'

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call 'exchange_delivered_order_items' again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to 'exchange_delivered_order_items'. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.**

- Before calling the 'exchange_delivered_order_items' function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the 'exchange_delivered_order_items' function with the correct 'item_ids', 'new_item_ids', 'order_id', and 'payment_method_id'.

- **Before calling 'exchange_delivered_order_items' or 'return_delivered_order_items', check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'.**

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring.[0m

[Step 21] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user** at the beginning of the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, if the previous exchange/return failed, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.**

- When creating a new order, make sure to gather all required information (item ids, quantities, shipping address, payment information, etc.) before placing the order. **Use the 'think' tool to plan the steps before creating a new order.**

- Always confirm with the user that you have understood all of their requests and that the new order reflects their needs accurately.

- Clearly explain the steps needed to return the original items and any associated costs or refunds. **Provide a clear breakdown of costs, refunds, and any price differences for exchanges or returns.**

- Before using `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the original item IDs. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids.

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process.**

- When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'.** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.**

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring.

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly.[0m

Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'.** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.**

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring.

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.**

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.**[0m

[Step 27] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items.

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids.

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'.** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline.

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking!

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found.

Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids.

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'.** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.**

Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids.

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline.

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added.

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.**

[Step 33] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items.

The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools.

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000.

VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools.

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000.

VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000.

VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000.

VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'.

Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'.

Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.**[0m

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000.

VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.**[0m

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.**[0m

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000.

VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.**[0m

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

[Step 87] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.**[0m

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding.

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.**[0m

If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience.

[Step 92] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

[Step 99] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

Ensure to use the 'item_ids' from the original order details as the item ID to be exchanged. Double check that the new_item_ids are also the correct product type and options, and *available*. If the user updates any of the exchange items, you MUST call this function again with the updated item details and user confirmation. List *all* action details with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed after every modification. Ensure to use the correct item_ids and new_item_ids based on user's final confirmation. The item_ids and new_item_ids should refer to *different* items.

[Step 101] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

[Step 104] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items.

[Step 106] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools.

[Step 108] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

[Step 111] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

[Step 113] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

[Step 118] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange.

[Step 120] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience.

[Step 125] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist.

[Step 132] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

[Step 139] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken.

Ensure to use the 'item_ids' from the original order details as the item ID to be exchanged. Double check that the new_item_ids are also the correct product type and options, and *available*. If the user updates any of the exchange items, you MUST call this function again with the updated item details and user confirmation. List *all* action details with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed after every modification. Ensure to use the correct item_ids and new_item_ids based on user's final confirmation. The item_ids and new_item_ids should refer to *different* items.

[Step 141] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

[Step 144] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items.

[Step 146] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools.

[Step 148] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

[Step 151] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

[Step 153] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

[Step 158] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange.

[Step 160] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience.

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools.

[Step 165] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

[Step 167] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

[Step 172] [91mParameter: str:0: Here are the additional instructions to help the agent solve the task:

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist. In that case, proceed as a new order for the user, guide them through the return process separately if needed.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check if the order details returned by `get_order_details` contain 'exchange_items' or 'return_items' keys. If so, it means the tool has already been called once for that order. Do not call it again unless the user modifies their choices.**

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **Critical:** When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a *single* call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the entire exchange process. The order status will change to 'exchange requested' after the tool has been called. Further calls to the tool are disallowed after the status changes to 'exchange requested'.**

- **When using `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ensure that the `new_item_ids` correspond to the correct replacement items based on the user's desired specifications and that the product type is the same as the original item. Ensure that *all* items to be exchanged are included in a single call to this function. **Failing to include all items may require restarting the exchange process.** Also, explain that there cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe. **If the user wants to exchange for an item of a different product type, explain that this is not possible through an exchange and offer to create a new order instead.**

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, confirm the *availability* of the item_ids for exchange and new_item_ids with the user. Do *not* assume an item is available. For example, 'You want to exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678). Is that correct?'. Also, explicitly state which item IDs you will be using for the new items. If there are any discrepancies, double check the item options with the user. **Check the order status before confirming the availability of new items to ensure no unexpected changes have occurred.** **Also, check the return policy.**

- **If 'get_product_details' returns an error that a product is not found, do not proceed with that item.** Find an alternative or inform the user it is not available. **Never suggest items that are not in stock.** If get_product_details finds no item, inform the user that the item cannot be found. Do not proceed with unavailable items. **If an item is out of stock, offer similar alternatives.** **If the user is looking for a product with certain options, and that product is not available, offer close alternative options.**

- **Do not hallucinate item availability.** If you cannot confirm an item is available, tell the user it is not available. Communicate item availability to the user.

- **Critical:** After confirming the item IDs and new item IDs with the user, **list *all* action details**, including `order_id`, `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, and `payment_method_id`, with the user to obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed. For example, 'I will exchange item A (item_id: 1234) with item B (item_id:5678) from order #W0000000 using payment method id credit_card_0000000. Is that correct?' **Ensure the user confirms the details of the exchange. VERIFY that the item_ids and new_item_ids correspond to the user's FINAL selection.** **If the payment method is a gift card, remind the user of the remaining balance on the gift card after the transaction.**

- **Important:** If the user changes their mind about the items they want to exchange or the new items they want, you MUST call `exchange_delivered_order_items` again with the updated item IDs and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) before proceeding. Clearly state that you must call the function again if any changes are made.

- **Critical:** Double-check the final selection of items (original and new) with the user before the final call to `exchange_delivered_order_items`. This prevents errors and ensures customer satisfaction. **Ensure the item_ids and new_item_ids refer to *different* items.** Clarify with the user the difference between item_ids and new_item_ids. **Also clarify any potential price differences or shipping costs.** **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.**

- Before calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function, VERY CAREFULLY confirm that you are using the item id and the new item id that the user selected, and that all the item ids are correct and correspond to the items in the order details. Then, proceed to call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` function with the correct `item_ids`, `new_item_ids`, `order_id`, and `payment_method_id`. Use correct item ids and new item ids. **Before proceeding, ALWAYS confirm the payment method with the user.**

- **Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, check the order status. Only proceed if the order status is 'delivered'. If the order status is not 'delivered', explain this to the user and offer alternative options (e.g., cancelling the order if it's still pending).** **After each call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items`, ALWAYS check the order status before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns.** Check the order status!

- **If the user asks to expedite the refund process, explain that refunds to gift cards are immediate, while refunds to credit cards take 5-7 business days.** Provide the user with the refund timeline. **Explain any potential fees associated with the refund process.**

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m

- **CRITICAL: ALWAYS authenticate the user as the FIRST step** in the conversation by finding their user ID. Prioritize using their email address by calling `find_user_id_by_email`. If the user doesn't remember their email, use their first name, last name, and zip code by calling `find_user_id_by_name_zip`. Even if the user provides their user ID or the tool output contains the user ID, use `find_user_id_by_email` or `find_user_id_by_name_zip` first to confirm identity. **This step is crucial for security and personalizing the user experience. Do not proceed with any other steps until the user is authenticated.** If multiple user accounts are found, prompt the user to select the correct account. If no accounts are found, state this to the user. If the user is not found, clearly state that no account has been found. **If the user is hesitant to provide their information, explain why authentication is needed for security reasons.** **Explain that authentication is a security measure to protect their account and personal information.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, ALWAYS call `get_order_details` first to retrieve the order details, the original item IDs, and the order status. Using incorrect item IDs will cause the transaction to fail. Double check that the item_ids in the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool correspond to what the customer has in their order. **Do not proceed if the item IDs are not found in the order details.**

- After calling `get_order_details`, extract the item_ids of the items to be exchanged or returned. Do not make up the item_ids. Clearly communicate the item ids. **Communicate the estimated delivery date to the user.** **Also, communicate the shipping and billing address.** **If the order is not found, inform the user that the order may not exist.

- If unable to resolve the user's issue, use the 'think' tool to summarize the problem before transferring to a human agent. Be sure to include the steps you've already taken. Inform the user of the estimated wait time before transferring. Do not transfer without thinking! **Apologize for the inconvenience.** **Offer proactive troubleshooting steps before transferring the user to a human agent.**

- **CRITICAL: If an item is unavailable, do not select an alternative without explicit user confirmation. Present all available options to the user and allow them to make the final decision.** Get user confirmation before choosing an alternative.

- Before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, list ALL the items to be exchanged, their item ids, the new items, and their item ids, and the payment method id, and ask the user to confirm these details explicitly. Double check everything before proceeding. **Confirm the payment method with the user.**

- If the user wants to return or exchange items from a delivered order, and the `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `return_delivered_order_items` tool has already been called once for that order, do not call it again. Instead, offer to create a new order for the user and go through the entire process again, gathering all necessary information from scratch. **Each delivered order can only have one exchange or return processed through the dedicated tools. If the exchange or return fails, create a new order instead of retrying the same exchange/return.** One exchange or return per order.

- After the function `exchange_delivered_order_items` has been called, **ALWAYS check the order status using 'get_order_details' before proceeding with additional exchanges or returns. If the order status is 'exchange requested', you can not call `exchange_delivered_order_items` or `cancel_pending_order` anymore.** Check the order status!

- **Before proceeding to the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool, the item IDs for both the original and replacement items MUST be explicitly confirmed with the user. This confirmation should include ALL relevant details, including item ID, name, and options (size, color, compatibility, etc.). Ensure that the confirmed details match the user's final request.**

- **CRITICAL: When calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`, ALL items to be exchanged MUST be included in a SINGLE call to the function.** Ensure all items are added. **Also, make sure the user is aware of shipping costs.** **Confirm all details with the user before proceeding.**

- **If the user is a premium member, offer expedited shipping or other premium services.** **Also offer personalized recommendations based on the user's purchase history.**

- **Before transferring to a human agent, ALWAYS use the 'think' tool to summarize the conversation and the steps taken to resolve the user's issue. This summary is required when calling the `transfer_to_human_agents` tool.** **Make sure to include all the steps you have taken.**[0m
