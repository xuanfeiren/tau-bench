  "reasoning": "The agent failed to solve the task. The conversation history shows the agent successfully identified the items to exchange, found suitable replacements, and obtained user confirmation. However, the agent did not call the `exchange_delivered_order_items` to fulfill the user's request. The agent also didn't ask for the payment method before calling `exchange_delivered_order_items`. The additional instructions need to be updated to emphasize calling the appropriate tool (`exchange_delivered_order_items`) after confirmation and remind the agent to collect the payment method.",

  "reasoning": "The agent failed to complete the exchange request, repeatedly encountering \"new item not found or available\" errors when calling the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool. This indicates a problem with how the tool is being called, specifically with item id selection. The agent attempts several times to find suitable replacement keyboards, but consistently fails, cycling through the same options and producing the same errors. The additional instructions do not seem to be guiding the agent effectively. The agent is making multiple calls to `get_product_details` which suggests it is struggling to identify an appropriate item id, and then the `exchange_delivered_order_items` tool is called with a nonexistent item. The description for the exchange_delivered_order_items tool should be updated to clarify that the new_item_ids should be available and of the same product type. Also, instructions should guide the agent to confirm item availability before calling exchange_delivered_order_items.",

❌ Failed
LLM response:
 {
  "reasoning": "The agent failed to correctly execute the exchange order. The key issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect use of `exchange_delivered_order_items`:** The agent initially tried to exchange only the keyboard without including the smart thermostat, and later, repeatedly tried to use the tool even when the order status indicated an exchange was already in progress. Each subsequent call to `exchange_delivered_order_items` produced a 'non-delivered order cannot be exchanged' error, indicating a misunderstanding of the order's state after the first exchange attempt.\n2.  **Lack of clarity regarding item options during exchange:** The agent should have presented available options for the keyboard and thermostat explicitly to the user before calling the exchange tool. This avoids ambiguity and confirms the user's choice.\n3.  **Inaccurate assessment of the order status:** The agent misinterprets the 'exchange requested' status and fails to track the progress of the initiated exchange. The order status reflects that an exchange request has been initiated, not that the exchange has been completed.\n\nI will address these issues by improving the tool descriptions and the additional instructions.\n\nTool description modifications:\n\n*   `exchange_delivered_order_items`: Add clarity to the description emphasizing that all items for exchange must be included in a single call, and the importance of confirming item options with the user beforehand.\n\nAdditional instruction modifications:\n\n*   Add a step-by-step workflow for handling exchanges, focusing on:\n    *   Confirming the order status as 'delivered' before proceeding.\n    *   Collecting all item exchange requests and desired new options.\n    *   Presenting the available options to the user and confirming their choices.\n    *   Calling `exchange_delivered_order_items` only once with all confirmed items and options.\n    *   Double-checking the order status after calling exchange tool.\n    *   Describing the next steps to the user after the request is sent, including information about the follow up email.",
